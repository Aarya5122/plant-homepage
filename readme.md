## What I Learnt

This is a landing page for plant nursery created using HTML5 and CSS3 which helped me to understand the CSS Position property as well as flexbox concepts, pseudo properties, and background properties. Here I got a chance to explore the CSS Position Property. After quite a bit of hit and trail I got a clarity on the values on what to use when. I had also explored flexbox concepts. I also went through various background properties available. Explored Pseudo Properties as well. Overall It was a great experience.
